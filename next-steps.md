## Results  

- The TokTok Voice Agent was called **88 times** in one week. 
- All transcripts and MP3s stored for every conversation

## Next Steps  

The goal is to generate a business that is generating revenue based on the thesis that focusing on creating applications that engage Nigerians is one of the best low-hanging fruit to achieving the Stacks Roadmap KPIs.

We've secured the X and TikTok account for this campaign.

The next step is simple but not easy: go viral.

We are realistically optimistic that by spreading awareness about Stacks by speaking in Nigerian Pidgin - our content can go viral, starting with the goal of generating 1,000 organic followers on TikTok before the next Stacks Vibe Code Hackathon DoraHacks in less than a month's time.

Additional next steps:
- Continue attracting more teammates  
- Build out solutions on Stacks based on the thesis that **applications tailored for Nigerians can accelerate achievement of the Stacks Roadmap KPIs** leveraging sbtcpay.org and boostX as an easy and secure way to start generating transactions.
- Attract a banner sponsor to the page.
