## Problem-Worth Solving | Job-to-be-Done

What we have is a problem to communicate.

Do you know how Mr. Beast blew up? By thinking globally and acting locally.

Mr. Beast blew up because he hired well-known actors to re-dub his voice on his videos. There are stories of him hiring the voice actor for Spider-Man to re-dub his voice in different countries.

## Solution

What the learner learns is a function of what they already know.
- The Kullback-Leibler Divergence

Acting globally and thinking locally is how we onboard the next million Nigerian millionaires to the Stacks ecosystem. Nigeria already houses a large percentage of the world's bitcoin millionaires...it's time to zero to n this achievement by reimaigining and onboarding and UI/UX interface that speaks in the native Nigerian tongue: pidgin.

### sBTC Clarity Contract (author: @kai_builder on X | http://www.sbtcpay.org)

TokTok is built on the Stacks blockchain using a custom Clarity smart contract (`smart-contracts/sbtcpayorg.clar`) that implements sBTC (Stacks Bitcoin) functionality:

#### Key Features:
- **Dual Token System**: Implements both `sbtc-token` (available) and `sbtc-token-locked` (locked) fungible tokens
- **Protocol Functions**: Secure minting, burning, locking, and unlocking operations with protocol-level authorization
- **SIP-010 Compliance**: Full compatibility with Stacks Improvement Proposal 010 for fungible tokens
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk transfers and minting for improved user experience
- **Security**: Contract-caller validation ensures only authorized protocols can perform critical operations

#### Core Functions:
- `protocol-lock`: Locks sBTC tokens for Bitcoin bridge operations
- `protocol-unlock`: Unlocks sBTC tokens back to available state
- `protocol-mint`: Mints new sBTC tokens to recipients
- `transfer-many`: Batch transfer functionality for multiple recipients
- `get-balance`: Retrieves total, available, and locked token balances

The contract integrates with the sBTC registry for secure cross-chain Bitcoin operations, enabling seamless Bitcoin-to-Stacks transactions in Pidgin English.
